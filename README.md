# Toy Language Interpreter (Java)

A custom interpreter for a toy programming language developed as part of the **Advanced Methods of Programming (MAP)** course.

## 📌 Features

- Program execution stack
- Symbol table
- Heap memory management
- File table handling
- Static type checking
- Custom Abstract Data Types (Stack, Dictionary, List, Heap)
- Concurrency support
- Console interface
- JavaFX GUI for program visualization

## 🏗 Architecture

The project follows a layered architecture:

- **Model** – Expressions, Statements, Types, Values
- **ProgramState** – Execution stack, symbol table, heap, output
- **Repository** – Program storage and logging
- **Controller** – Execution management
- **View** – Console menu & JavaFX GUI

## 🛠 Technologies

- Java
- JavaFX
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Concurrency

## 🚀 What I Learned

- Interpreter design and execution flow
- Memory management using a custom heap
- Static type checking
- Multithreading with `ForkStmt`
- Clean layered architecture
